# Simplus Grid Tool (Version: v2025-Jul-12)

Simplus Grid Tool (SimplusGT in short) is an open-source tool for dynamic analysis and time-domain simulation of power systems (large-scale 100+ bus systems, SG-IBR-composite systems, AC or DC or hybrid AC-DC systems, HVDC systems, etc). The tool is based on Matlab/Simulink.

## System Requirement

Matlab 2020a or later, with Simulink, Simscape/PowerSystem.

## Quick Start

Copy the repository (download all codes) into your PC, and run "InstallSimplusGT.m" by Matlab. That's all! 

Run "UserMain.m" and you will automatically get results of an example 4-bus power system whose default parameters are saved in "UserData.xlsm". More examples can be found in "Examples" folder.

## Documentations

The comments in "UserMain.m" and "UserData.xlsm" are very important. Please read them carefully. More details can be found in manuals in "Documentations" folder.

## Citation

We would be very grateful if you could cite the toolbox when you used it in your publications and projects as "github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool".
