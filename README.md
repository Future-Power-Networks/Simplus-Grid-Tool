## System Requirement

Matlab 2016a or later, with Simulink, Simscape/PowerSystem.

## Quick Start

Copy the repository (download all codes) into your PC, and run "InstallSimplusGT.m" by Matlab. That's all! 

Run "UserMain.m" and you will automatically get results of an example 4-bus power system whose default parameters are saved in "UserData.xlsm". More examples can be found in "Examples" folder.

## Documentations

The comments in "UserMain.m" and "UserData.xlsm" are very important. Please read them carefully. More details can be found in manuals in "Documentations" folder.
