# SimplexPowerSystems (Version: v2021-APR-20)

SimplexPowerSystems (SimplexPS, in short) is an open-source toolbox for dynamic analysis and simulation of power systems (large-scale, multi-machine, generator-converter-composite, AC or DC or hybrid AC-DC).

The toolbox is based on Matlab/Simulink but is going to be extended to Python. To be continued.
